Welcome to MyLingva - your personal vocabulary manager! If you are looking for a way to extend your vocabulary in one or more languages by browsing the internet, this might be of interest to you.

## What is the idea behind MyLingva?
The system knows the languages you speak and helps you learn new words by emphasizing them in the texts your read. Words are stored in order for you to refresh your vocabulary by viewing the context you've previously seen them in or by using flash cards.

In case you are multilingual, MyLingva can translate a word to all the languages you know, thus improving your lookup capabilities in more than one language as opposed to memorizing pairs of words. (Especially helpful when those words sound somehow similar in close languages, say Polish and Ukrainian).

When you are writing a new text yourself (e.g. an email) the system can suggest using recently learned words as synonyms to the words you type, therefore helping you enrich your written/spoken vocabulary.

## Where are you now?
We are just about to publish the very first prototype of the Chrome extension which stores the words you encounter and highlights their familiarity level, allowing you to edit it. We currently support 5 languages: English, Ukrainian, Romanian, Polish and German. Apart from the words, we also store up to 10 sentences each word was used in. (There's no way to see/manage them yet, sorry!)

When you open any page which contains text, click on the extension icon in Chrome and MyLingva will highlight all the unknown words using red. (Initially all the text will be red.) By hovering over a word and using the displayed menu you can mark it as known, ignored, or familiar to you.

You can see all the recorded words under the extension's settings. (Right click on the extension icon -> Options).

The words are currently being stored locally within your browser and will not be uploaded anywhere else. If you wish to wipe out your Dictionary all you need to do is uninstall the extension. We will be working on a backend in order to synchronize your dictionary between devices and make it available on the web but we still have a long way to go.

## What about my privacy?
* The extension can only see the texts within the tabs you enable MyLingva for, by clicking on the icon.
* As mentioned above, all the recorded information is being stored inside the local storage of your browser and is not being uploaded anywhere else. The access to the collected data is as restricted/protected as your computer is.

MyLingva reports actions [anonymously] users are doing via Google Analytics so we can sentence how it is being used and by how many people. However, we can not link any action to a particular user, all usage being anonymous.

What is being reported to Google Analytics:
* urls which are visited (unless in incognito mode)
* words that are being marked as known/ignored/etc.

All of the above is anonymous and we are not able to identify which actions are done by whom.
